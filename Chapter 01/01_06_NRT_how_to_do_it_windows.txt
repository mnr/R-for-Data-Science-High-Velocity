Notes on Near Real Time demonstration.

For Windows

This demo is somewhat complex and involves a bit of set up. You'll need to start the high velocity simulator, start another process to build the SQLite database, and start a third R program to gather data from the SQLite database.

I assume the following folder/file structure:

Exercise Files
- HighVelocityDataSimulator.R
- HighVelocitySimulation.txt
- Chapter 01
-- 01_06_NRT_processing.R
-- acquisition.R

1) Open Rgui from the start menu.

2) setwd() to "Exercise Files" or use File-> set directory

3) open HighVelocityDataSimulator.R .. This program should be in the root level of the Exercise Files folder.

4) Start HighVelocityDataSimulator.R .(Edit -> Run All). This will begin updating HighVelocitySimulation.txt, overwriting the previous data in this file. This simulates high velocity data as might be pulled from a hardware register.

5) Open another new instance of R. Typically this is done by starting a new Rgui.

6) setwd() (change dir) to "Exercise Files / Chapter 01"

7) open acquisition.R and "run all". You may have to select a CRAN mirror. This will create a file titled AcquisitionDB.SQLite. If you see path errors, check the pathname assigned to HighVelSimTxt. It should point to HighVelocitySimulation.txt

8) Open yet another new instance of R. Typically this is done by starting a new Rgui.

9) setwd() to "Exercise Files / Chapter 01"

10) start 01_06_NRT_processing.R. This will write to the console, something along the line of "With 13 observations, the mean of V3 is 137"

11) Viola - you are demonstrating near real time processing!
